A motor scintillates
An interior star
Two doors, two seats
Two of us
Hold it for a second

Inside the night sky 
of a car.

The visions above us lapse
Years just pass
Like the pictures

Two bodies separate
Kiss on a moon
A guiding orb

Voice of a soul
Eyes meet, open

Light drains everything
I didn't think of everything

Transformation

Cover of dark, I'm warm
My hand, in time in the wool.
