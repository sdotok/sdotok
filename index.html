Wake Up, We're in The Abyss

A motor scintillates
An interior star
Two doors, two seats
Hold it for a second
Two of us

Inside the night sky 
of a car.

The visions above us lapse
Years just pass
Like the pictures

Two bodies separate
Kiss on a moon
A guiding orb

Voice of a soul
Eyes meet, open

Light drains everything
I didn't think of everything

Transformation

Cover of dark, I'm warm
My hand, in time in the wool.

Alone Supernatural, Bob Uncle Is A Ninja

Have to get this down, 
Down, quick!
Bomb blasts and shells
My breath curdles in the air
Crackle through the thick air, my being, electric

Tens of thousands of years ago I heard a story
Had a dream a thousand years ago, you're sorry
You succumb, you stare, you're ugly
Can't stand your reflection in the mirror
Sorry, 
Not something I've gone through
Up to my knees in sand with only the sun looking back at me

I am a liquid sheathed and protected
Red gold, blue violet, red orange blue green skin velvet 
Protect it, silence
I am a water-covered berry in the sunlight
Seeds in your teeth,
Heaped up crying 
Pleading for death, but
Death screams "Quiet!"

January Process

Black ink pours over my eyes from my eyelids,
Hot wax, melted over the mask of my face.
My black hair uncovered, ungoverned, in my hands
Roll back the stories in my big pompous head

I can tell you what love is not
Today, I'll tell you a lot more

Everyone starts off a baby
Sometimes, kids fall in love
Brothers and sisters love eachother like crazy
Then, all the children go to war

I am not forgiving by nature
I am a statistic, I'm scarred
Barely get through my days now

Can you accept the truth?

Love is a look out the window,
where the window looks back at you
Everything is green.
Sky, blue
Your eyes, they become a window, too

and this goes on forever. Back and forth like a flicker

Isn't the thought of eternity magnificent?
Beauty, in love? Prudent, pertinent? 
Significant?

I don't know, to me, it seems kind of fated,
though, it's given me some time to think.

Love is clearing away the veils from your eye balls,
Chancing, giving yourself more, deep inhale, eyes closed

Love is crushing down the pain, and getting crushed up again and again, 
Changing. Hurting, you fracture into pulp. Nobody minds,
More breathing
More breathing
A fragment, split off from a verse, and a fruit
It's a hundred lines of poetry, for love.

Untitled Poem Where I Go (In My Free Time)

I follow myself 
To the core,

Through the past.

Through blood, through code, through decay, through arrest

I'm not let in
I cut off heads
Chained, and fired
Yeah, I search, I know,
I fall down, get spiked 
Deep god damn hole.

Real easy, now, you're wounded...

I don't understand, I tune out

We'll fix this...

Run the production, start scrambling

Oh, look at that, she's impaled.

Looks and safety
held by nothing,
nothing, 
more nothing,
Impressive.

Shocked, I hear a big pitch and an anthem
what is this? A bated breath
I'm lost and drenched with emotion.
In a net coursing through me
Suddenly the past is in love
