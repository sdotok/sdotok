A motor scintillates
An interior star
Two doors, two seats
Two of us
Hold it for a second

Inside the night sky 
of a car.

The visions above us lapse
Years just pass
Like the pictures

Two bodies separate
Kiss on a moon
A guiding orb

Voice of a soul
Eyes meet, open

Light drains everything
I didn't think of everything

Transformation

Cover of dark, I'm warm
My hand, in time in the wool.

<br>

Have to get this down, 
Down, quick!
Bomb blasts and shells
My breath curdles in the air
Crackle through the thick air, my being, electric

Tens of thousands of years ago I heard a story
Had a dream a thousand years ago, you're sorry
You succumb, you stare, you're ugly
Can't stand your reflection in the mirror
Sorry, 
Not something I've gone through
Up to my knees in sand with only the sun looking back at me

I am a liquid sheathed and protected
Red gold, blue violet, red orange blue green velvet 
Protect me, I give up, silence
I am a water-covered berry in the sunlight
Seeds in your teeth,
Heaped up crying 
Pleading for death, but
Death sleeps.

<br>
