Wake Up, We're in The Abyss

A motor scintillates
An interior star
Two doors, two seats
Two of us
Hold it for a second

Inside the night sky 
of a car.

The visions above us lapse
Years just pass
Like the pictures

Two bodies separate
Kiss on a moon
A guiding orb

Voice of a soul
Eyes meet, open

Light drains everything
I didn't think of everything

Transformation

Cover of dark, I'm warm
My hand, in time in the wool.

Alone

Have to get this down, 
Down, quick!
Bomb blasts and shells
My breath curdles in the air
Crackle through the thick air, my being, electric

Tens of thousands of years ago I heard a story
Had a dream a thousand years ago, you're sorry
You succumb, you stare, you're ugly
Can't stand your reflection in the mirror
Sorry, 
Not something I've gone through
Up to my knees in sand with only the sun looking back at me

I am a liquid sheathed and protected
Red gold, blue violet, red orange blue green skin velvet 
Protect it, silence
I am a water-covered berry in the sunlight
Seeds in your teeth,
Heaped up crying 
Pleading for death, but
Death screams "quiet!"

Amaranthus January

Black ink pours over my eyes from my eyelids,
Hot wax, melted over the mask of my face
My black hair uncovered, ungoverned in my hands
Roll back the stories in my big pompous head
I can tell you what love is not
Today, I'll tell you a lot more

Everyone starts off a baby
Sometimes, kids fall in love
Brothers and sisters love eachother like crazy
Then, all the children go to war

I am not forgiving by nature
I am a statistic, I'm scarred
I barely get through my days now

Can you accept the truth?

Love is a look out the window,
where the window looks back at you
Everything is green. The sky, blue
Your eyes, become a window, too,
and this goes on forever.

Isn't the thought of beauty magnificent?
How about eternity, in love? Prudent, pertinent? 
Significant?

I don't know, to me, it seems kind of fated,
Though it's given me some time to think.

Love is pushing yourself up, 
Removing the veils from your eyes, 
Forgoing control, forgiving,
Forgiving yourself more than anything

Love is crushing,
You can feel it crush down the pain,
You can feel yourself getting crushed
and changing. Again and again

Show yourself who you are, love said to me,
I threaten your security,
I threaten to destabilize everything

Love said, I'm coming for you,
And you're not going to know what to do.
