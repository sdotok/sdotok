A motor scintillates
An interior star
Two doors, two seats
Two of us
Hold it for a second

Inside the night sky 
of a car.

The visions above us lapse
Years just pass
Like the pictures

Two bodies separate
Kiss on a moon
A guiding orb

Voice of a soul
Eyes meet, open

Light drains everything
I didn't think of everything

Transformation

Cover of dark, I'm warm
My hand, in time in the wool.

-

Have to get this down, down quick
Bomb blasts and shells
My breath curdles in the air
Crackle through the thick air, my being, electric

Tens of thousands of years ago I heard a story
Had a dream a thousand years ago, you're sorry
You succumb, you stare, you're thoughtless, ugly
Can't stand your reflection in the mirror, Sorry
Not something I've gone through
