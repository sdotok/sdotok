ABOUT ME

I have spent my life defending myself from unwanted public opinions and external forces. 

In 2028, I plan to run for the Office of the President of the United States of America.

PLEDGE

I pledge allegiance to the Flag 
of the United States of America, 
and to the Republic for which it stands, 
one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
